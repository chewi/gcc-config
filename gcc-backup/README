What is gcc-backup
==================

gcc-backup is a directory to backup critical runtime
libraries used by gcc to link in code too big to inline it
from code generator.

See gcc/doc/libgcc.texi doc in gcc source tree.

gcc-config is responsible to back up libgcc_s.so.* and it's
runtime dependencies.

Which systems needed this backup
================================

During normal system operation these libraries should not be
needed (unless gcc installation is somehow completely broken).

The main use case for libgcc-backup is booting of a system
with the following properties:
- '/usr' mount is separate from '/' mount
- AND binaries in /bin (say, /bin/bash) are executed before
  /usr is mounted

Which systems link libgcc_s.so in
=================================

By default gcc attempts to link libgcc_s.so in into every
binary and shared library. If code generator happens to
generate the code that does not refer libgcc_s.so then
-Wl,--as-needed linker option omits the dependency.

Thus any system might have libgcc_s.so linked into any binary
or shared library.

What goes into this directory
=============================

- libgcc_s.so.* itself: gcc driver attempts to link it in as-is
- libunwind.so.*: ia64-*-linux only, a runtime dependency of
                  libgcc_so.so.*
